Find database of excercises

Things to store:
  Current Selected Routine
  Log data structure?
  Archive log after a year?
  Import/Export from csv?

Need to figure out how I want to have people setup their routine
  Build Out Routine Builder

  Build Out workout editor

  Build Out logging view/editor

  Make some Mocks of screens

  Handle A/B day type workouts

  Handle ability to change workout from list of presets for a particular day


Testing Data Structure for Logging
log = {
  12/20/2018: {
    name: 'LowerStrength', // maps to key name of workout
    sets: [
      {
        name: 'Barbell Squat',
        warmups: [

        ],
        worksets: [
          {
            weight: 225,
            reps: 8
          }
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
};

New file Every Year?
New file every day?
New file every week? ... ????

Figure out how to store current log data
  Create Log On Load
    Object will initially be whatever was in the original object in the routine
    But can be customized on a day to day basis
  When add exercise or set where do we store it?
  Store it in localData? 
    will get added in when we load
